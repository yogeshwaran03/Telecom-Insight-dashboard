# Telecom Marketing KPIs Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** for a large telecom company to track key performance indicators (KPIs) related to **customer satisfaction**, **call center operations**, and **agent performance**. The goal of this dashboard is to provide actionable insights that help the telecom company optimize its marketing strategies, customer service processes, and resource allocation.

## Objective

The dashboard will allow stakeholders (e.g., marketing managers, customer service teams, and executives) to track the following key metrics:
- **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)**
- **Call Center Metrics** (e.g., calls answered, abandoned calls, average speed of answer)
- **Agent Performance** (e.g., average handle time vs. calls answered)

The final dashboard will be interactive, visually appealing, and capable of offering real-time insights that drive data-driven decisions for improving customer service and marketing effectiveness.

## Key Features

- **Customer Satisfaction Scores**: Track trends in customer satisfaction over time and by customer segments.
- **Call Center Metrics**:
  - Calls answered vs. abandoned
  - Calls by time of day (heatmaps)
  - Average speed of answer (ASA)
- **Agent Performance Analysis**:
  - Performance quadrant (average handle time vs. calls answered)
  - Agent-specific metrics (e.g., AHT, call resolution rates)
- **Call Volume Trends**: Visualize the volume of incoming calls over various time intervals (hourly, daily, monthly).

## KPIs and Metrics

The following KPIs are central to this dashboard:

1. **Overall Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)**
   - Visualize the average customer satisfaction score over time, with breakdowns by customer segments.
   
2. **Calls Answered vs Abandoned**
   - Track the number and percentage of calls answered vs. abandoned in real-time.
   
3. **Calls by Time of Day**
   - Heatmap or line graph of call volumes segmented by time of day or day of week.

4. **Average Speed of Answer (ASA)**
   - Track the average time taken to answer calls, providing insights into the efficiency of the call center.

5. **Agent Performance Quadrant**
   - A scatter plot showing agent performance based on:
     - X-axis: Calls answered
     - Y-axis: Average Handle Time (AHT)

6. **Call Resolution Rate**
   - Measure the percentage of calls resolved during the first contact vs those that require escalation.

7. **Call Volume Trends**
   - A time-series chart displaying the volume of calls over different time periods (e.g., daily, weekly).

## Data Requirements

To implement this dashboard, the following data fields are required:
- **Customer Satisfaction Scores** (e.g., from post-call surveys or ratings)
- **Call Center Data**:
  - Total number of calls
  - Calls answered and abandoned
  - Call duration (in seconds or minutes)
  - Time of the call (timestamp)
- **Agent Data**:
  - Number of calls handled by each agent
  - Average Handle Time (AHT)
  - Number of escalations or resolutions
- **Time-Based Data**:
  - Hour of the day or day of the week when the call was received

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Power Query**: To clean, transform, and model the data.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For custom calculations and creating KPIs.
- **GitHub**: For version control and sharing the project.

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

To start working with the project, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/telecom-kpi-dashboard.git
```

### 2. Data Preparation

Ensure you have the necessary data in the following format:
- An Excel file or CSV containing the call center data (calls answered, abandoned, call duration, etc.).
- An Excel file or CSV containing customer satisfaction scores.
- An Excel file or CSV containing agent performance metrics (calls answered, AHT, etc.).

### 3. Power BI Report

- Open the **Power BI Desktop** application.
- Import the data files into Power BI.
- Use **Power Query** to clean and transform the data as required.
- Create custom KPIs using **DAX** formulas (e.g., CSAT, calls answered vs abandoned).
- Design the dashboard using **various visualizations** such as bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

### 4. Publish to Power BI Service

Once your Power BI dashboard is ready:
- Publish the report to the **Power BI Service** for sharing and collaboration with other stakeholders.

## Visualizations and Layout

The dashboard will include the following visualizations:

- **KPI Tiles**: To display metrics such as CSAT and ASA.
- **Bar/Donut Charts**: For visualizing calls answered vs. abandoned.
- **Heatmaps/Line Charts**: To show calls by time of day.
- **Scatter Plot**: To represent agent performance with AHT vs. calls answered.
- **Time-Series Chart**: To visualize call volume trends.

## How to Use the Dashboard

Once the dashboard is set up and published, users can interact with the visuals in several ways:

1. **Filters and Slicers**: Filter data by time periods, agents, or customer segments.
2. **Hover for Tooltips**: Hovering over elements will display detailed information, such as specific agent performance or call details.
3. **Interactive Drill-Downs**: Click on a visual element (e.g., a time period) to drill down and view more granular data.

## Future Improvements

- Add **real-time data integration** for live call center monitoring.
- Implement **machine learning models** to predict call volumes and satisfaction scores.
- Include a **sentiment analysis** of customer feedback to better understand CSAT.
